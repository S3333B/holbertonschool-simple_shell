## Project GitHub Flow

For this project we will use externals ressources in order to have a nice collaboration flow.

Using keywords to prefix branches and commits messages like:

- feat
- docs
- fix

<u>examples</u>:\
branch -> "feat/build-main-header"\
commit -> "docs: adding gitflow chapter to readme"

### How to push my work ?

In order to make a new feature, fix or documentation I need to make a new branch as explain above. 
```bash
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

When work is done I fetch the parent branch (dev) to see there is some change, if there are changes I need to pull and merge.
```bash
git checkout dev
git fetch
git pull
git checkout <working-branch>
git merge dev
```
This process avoids breaking dev or main branch. So I need to resolve conflict on my working branch before making a PR on GitHub and merge on dev.

If I have a new PR from my coworker I need to check his code and  comment if I have questions or validate the PR to merge.
